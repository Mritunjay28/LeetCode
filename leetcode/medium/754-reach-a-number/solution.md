AmazonYou are standing at position 0 on an infinite number line. There is a destination at position target. You can make some number of moves numMoves so that: On each move, you can either go left or right. During the ith move (starting from i == 1 to i == numMoves), you take i steps in the chosen direction. Given the integer target, return the minimum number of moves required (i.e., the minimum numMoves) to reach the destination.
